Microsoft tutorial:

In this tutorial, I create a simple utility library that contains a single string-handling method.

About the program:

The code uses the row variable to maintain a count of the number of rows of data written to the console window.
Whenever it's greater than or equal to 25, the code clears the console window and displays a message to the user.

The program prompts the user to enter a string. It indicates whether the string starts with an uppercase character. 
If the user presses the Enter key without entering a string, the application ends, and the console window closes.
